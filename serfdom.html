                        <p>Shevchenko grew up in a poor peasant family, and from an early age he saw hard labor and injustice. The serfs were actually the property of the lord and had to work for him, obey his orders, and had no right to leave the estate without permission. The lord could sell, punish, or even divorce the serf's family. For disobedience, peasants were severely punished with whips, flogging, or exile. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">(Source)</a></p>
                        <p>Young Shevchenko was sent to herd cattle, where he could only dream of studying. He often ran away to the village clerk, where he learned to read and write. He was fond of drawing, drawing with chalk on walls, gates, and doors. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">(Source)</a></p>
                        <p>In 1829, when Shevchenko was 15 years old, he was taken to the estate of Pavlo Engelhardt (Vasyl's son).
                            He became a “Cossack,” that is, a servant of the lord, running small errands, serving things, and waiting at the table.
                            The master often beat him for disobedience or poor work. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">(Source)</a></p>

                        <p>When he noticed that Taras had a talent for painting, his father decided to use it to his advantage. In 1831, Engelhardt sent him to Vilnius, and then to St. Petersburg, where he studied under the painter Vasyl Shyriayev. Taras worked for his lord: he painted walls, drew portraits, and even created decorative paintings for the lord's estates. Despite the fact that he gained access to education, he was still a serf and could not control his own destiny. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">(Source)</a></p>

                    <div class="serfdom__text">
                        <p>While in St. Petersburg, Taras met the artist Ivan Soshenko, who, together with literary figures Karl Bryullov, Vasyl Zhukovsky, and others, decided to buy him out of his master. Karl Bryullov painted a portrait of Vasyl Zhukovsky. The portrait was sold at auction for 2500 rubles. On April 22, 1838, Taras was redeemed from serfdom and granted his freedom. After that, he entered the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, where he revealed himself as a poet and artist. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">(Source)</a></p>
