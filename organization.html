                            In April 1946, Taras Shevchenko joined the Cyril and Methodius Society. Shevchenko's acquaintance with one of the founders of the organization, Kostomarov, can be considered a prerequisite for joining the society. The famous historian Bahalii pointed out “that the poet, having joined the secret society, became perhaps its most active figure, spreading revolutionary ideas among the people through his works.” <a href="https://taras-shevchenko.com.ua/ua/biography/taras-shevchenko-i-kirilo-mefodiyivske-bratstvo.htm">(Source)</a>

                        <p>
                            Summarizing the historian's words, we can say with conviction that Shevchenko had a huge impact on society with his revolutionary democratic beliefs. It is his revolutionary works such as “Caucasus,” “Dream,” “The Great Cellar,” and “To the Dead and the Living and the Unborn...” that are undoubtedly proof of this. It was these works of Shevchenko's that later became one of the most compelling pieces of evidence against them when they were arrested. Ukrainian scientist, publicist, historian, and philosopher Mykhailo Drahomanov said that “Shevchenko stood ahead of his learned friends, the Kyivan Slavophiles, and the hot public opinion, and the same Ukrainianism.” Shevchenko came to Ukraine from St. Petersburg with ready-made thoughts about the freedom of Ukraine from the Moscow tsars. <a href="https://taras-shevchenko.com.ua/ua/biography/taras-shevchenko-i-kirilo-mefodiyivske-bratstvo.htm">(Source)</a>

                        <p>The Cyril and Methodius Society existed for a little over a year. In March 1947, a student at Kyiv University, Petrov, denounced the society's activities, which resulted in its exposure. After that, Russian imperial officials banned the society's further activities. Members of the society were sentenced to various years of exile. Shevchenko himself suffered the most: he was conscripted as a soldier for 10 years with a ban on writing and drawing. <a href="https://taras-shevchenko.com.ua/ua/biography/taras-shevchenko-i-kirilo-mefodiyivske-bratstvo.htm">(Source)</a></p>
