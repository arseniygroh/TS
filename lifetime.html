                            <p>Taras Shevchenko began writing poetry in the second half of the 1930s. In 1840, his first collection of poems “Kobzar” was published in St. Petersburg, and in 1845, the heroic romantic poem “The Haidamaks” was published. In 1843-45, he wrote a cycle of poems “Three Summers” (the central work of which is “Dream”), the poem “Caucasus,” the message “To the Dead and the Living...”, the poems “Chyhyryn, Chyhyryn,” “The Great Cellar,” “Standing in the Village of Subotiv,” and others, in which he sharply opposed the social and national oppression of the Ukrainian people. During his imprisonment, he wrote poetry, which he later combined into the cycle “In the Casemate”. In 1854-1858, he wrote the novels The Musician, The Artist, The Unfortunate, The Captain, and The Twins in Russian. Shevchenko's last prose works are the story “A Walk with Pleasure and Not Without Morals” (1856-1858) and his diary entries “Journal”. In Ukraine in 1858 Taras Shevchenko wrote a number of high examples of intimate and landscape poetry. Several of Shevchenko's works of this period were published in the magazine “Osnova” and the almanac “Hata”. <a href="https://knu.ua/geninf/Shevchenko">(Source)</a></p>
